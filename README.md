### Miscellaneous projects from throughout the years, most of these are hobby projects.

Libraries that I used can be found here:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_DzLWVoPPGleldKQ1paNC1JdG8

Preferably download the newest versions of these libraries from official sources if you can. I do not in any way take credit for any of these libraries.

### Plug'n'play

The libraries used for each project are included next to the project files and the Visual Studio solution is set up to target the include and library files that it needs from those folders. I set it up this way so that you should be able to open the .sln file and build it without any extra configuration.

If you are using different versions of the same libraries, or if you wish to use the library files from somewhere else, then you will need to set them up yourself. You can do this by right clicking the project in Visual Studio and setting the "Include" and "Library" directories in the "VC++ Directories" menu.

You can also simply run the compiled .exe for each project that is included in each project folder under "Release".
